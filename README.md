# REST_API_Coding-Challenge
A REST API created for the Thirdfort coding challenge

## How to run the API
To run the API, multiple python dependencies are needed and you can install all the required dependencies by the running the following command:
```
pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy flask-marshmallow marshmallow-sqlalchemy marshmallow
```
1.  **Flask** install the flask micro-framework to python.
2.  **Flask-SQLAlchemy** adds SQLAlchemy.
3.  **flask-marshmallow** adds the flask part of mashmallow.
4.  **marshmallow-sqlalchemy** allow programs to serialize and deserialize Python objects generated by SQLAlchemy.
5.  **marshmallow** adds the Marshmallow functionality.

Once all the dependencies have been installed, the following command can be runned to initialise the server:
```
python app.py
```
This should initialise a server at `http://localhost:5000`, since no `.html` have been created to support the API. To run the function located in the `app.py`, we have to invoke `curl` within the terminal to call up these funtions.

## The functions
All functions are associated with the `http://localhost:5000/api` URI and they can be invoked by calling the correct `curl` commands.

### Creating a new node
```
curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d "{""user_id"":1, ""title"":""Do work"", ""description"":""REST API""}" http://localhost:5000/api/tasks/create
```
This will create a new node within the database for `user_id:1` by invoking the `POST` method.
